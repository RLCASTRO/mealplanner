          Introduction
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph align="left">
          Greener Village offers meal planning services to clients free of charge using its Meals
          Made Simple system. The process uses Greener Village staff and volunteers to help clients
          develop meal plans that meet the needs of their families.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph align="left">
          The primary focus of the service is to help clients plan and budget for food. Greener
          Village does not employ medical professionals and does not provide medical diagnostic or
          treatment advice to clients. The organization relies fully upon clients to ensure that the
          meals they select are safe and appropriate for their family to eat given the personal
          health conditions of family members.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph align="left">
          Greener Village also relies fully upon clients to safely prepare and store meals they
          prepare. The organization can help clients access food safe handling information and it
          may periodically offer courses in its Learning Kitchen.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph align="left">
          A secondary focus of the meal planning service is to help clients understand how their
          meal plans compare to recommendations in Canadaâ€™s Food Guide. Greener Village does not
          employ dietary or nutritional professionals but it uses such people to provide overall
          ratings of various common meal plans.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph align="left">
          If clients are in need of assistance from trained dietary or nutritional professionals to
          improve the healthiness of their meal plans, Greener Village will help them contact an
          expert or it may sponsor courses to help groups of clients.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph align="left">
          Greener Village plans to work with Food Banks Canada to offer Meals Made Simple to food
          banks across Canada. As part of this national effort, data will be collected to measure
          the effectiveness of the meal planning and budgeting system in helping Canadian families
          reduce food insecurity and enhance healthier eating habits.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph align="left">
          Client confidentiality will be protected at every stage of the implementation of the
          service and the development and use of the database.
